          What up my nerds! 
          <br />
          <br />
          Welcome to the website. You may be wondering who I am at this point. I was born and raised in Evanston, IL. I'm graduating from Case Western with a double major in Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering in May of 2017. I'm a member of the Case Western Menâ€™s Varsity Tennis Team. I personally believe most people who do not play a sport in college underestimate the commitment that varsity athletics require. So to set the record straight, I have dedicated about twenty hours a week year round to training for Case Tennis. This has entirely shaped who I am and I'm proud of that.
          <br />
          <br />
          My real passion is web development. I'm a full stack web developer; which means I'm generalist who has some experience with technologies ranging from Docker to React. I love learning and I think new emerging technologies are dope, especially when they involve JavaScript.

          Give me a little coffee, a vim text editor, Kanye West's full discography, and a StackOverflow account and I can make anything.
